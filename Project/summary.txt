Project C Summary

The main goal of this project is to find solutions for the linear advection equation with certain conditions set to the constants. The Fortran section is where
most of the code will live. In this section, I will have to discretize, enforce initial conditions and boundary conditions for the advection part and diffusion
parts of the linear advection equation. The Python section requires me to make different figures with multiple graphs in them. 

1. Find solutions to 1D diffusion equation
2. Find solutions to 1D advection equation
3. Create plots for solutions at specific times
4. Create plots for initial conditions
5. Create plots for initial profile and final profiles.
6. Write the report with abstract, body, figures, and conclusion
7. Solve full advection and diffusion equation using the splitting method
